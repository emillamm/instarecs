instarecs
=========

A shortcut to powerful recommendations using pairwise comparisons instead of ratings. 

# Intro #
Instarecs is a python implementation of a collaborative filtering algorithm that is based on pairwise comparisons instead of ratings (Usually collaborative filters relies on ratings or likes/dislikes). The purpose of using comparisons instead of ratings, is to eliminate the bias that typically is associated with ratings. 
A live implementation of the algorithm can be found on flicked.co. 

Instarecs is purely written in Python and all data is stored in a MongoDB database. 

# Prerequisites #
Following Python libraries are needed: 
- annoy (also depends on Boost)
- pymongo
- numpy
- jsonrpclib

An installation of MongoDB is also required. 

# Setup #
To try out instarecs, make sure that MongoDB is running and then simply run demo.py. 

# Usage #
